WPilot
------
Welcome to WPilot server. A proof-of-concept remake of the old classic game XPilot (http://www.xpilot.org/), this time in your web browser. The game uses
new fancy HTML5 features such as WebSocket and Canvas to make it possible.

Please visit project homepage for more details. http://jfd.github.com/wpilot/


Server requirements
-------------------
You need Node.js in order to run the server. Download (or clone) Node.js at http://nodejs.org/

Quick start
-----------
You can start the game- and client server by typing:

	./wpilots.js
	
If you want to enable flash support you need to run the server with the -p switch (note: The Flash Policy Server requires you to run as root):

	./wpilots -p
	
After that, start your webbrowser of choice and connect to the specified 
address (default is: http://127.0.0.1:6114).
	
For more more switched, start the server with the '-H' (will change to --help when Node.js supports it) switch.
